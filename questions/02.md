# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```python
class Pet:
  def __init__ (self, name):
    self.name = name

dog = Pet("Harpo")
```

In the example above, `Pet("Harpo")` will instantiate a new instance of
the`Pet`class.

## Correct

True

> Yes! The class has been declared correctly, so a new instance will be returned
> when the code is run.

## Incorrect

False

> Try running the code. Why did you think a new instance of `Pet` would not be
> created?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
