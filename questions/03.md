# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```python
class Pet:
  def __init__ (self, name):
    self.name = name 

  def print_name(self, name):
    print(self.name)

dog = Pet
dog.print_name()
```

`Pet` in this example will instantiate a new instance of the `Pet` class
and`print_name()` will print nothing.

## Correct

False

> Correct! We need to provide a name when instantiating an instance of
> the`Pet`class because that's what `initialize` expects. We'll get a TypeError
> when we try to use the name attribute.

## Incorrect

True

> This is a bit of a tough question. Take a look at the ` __init__ ` function and
> then the last line of code. What do you notice?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
