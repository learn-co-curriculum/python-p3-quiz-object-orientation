# Getter Methods

Consider the following code:

```python
class Pet:
  def __init__ (self, name):
    self.name = name

rabbit = Pet("Jabby")
print(rabbit.name)
```

`rabbit.name` in this example will return `"Jabby"`.

## Correct

True

> Yes! The `name` method will return the value stored in `self.name`, which was
> set to `"Jabby"` when this pet was initialized.

## Incorrect

False

> What happens when you run the code? How and why does that differ from what you
> expected? Which methods are available in `Pet` and what do they do?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
